http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-31/?uid=43403

This game is about survival. You have to defeat a maximum number of enemy waves. Each enemy killed is added to your score. Be careful, you have only one life. 

This games was made using Unity 3D, C# and Photoshop. 

I would like to thanks Robert del Naja for the music, those free jam asset were amazing, and BFXR for all the sound FX. 

The game is pretty simple to play, you can turn left or right with your arrow keys or A/D. Use your mouse to shoot and to grab some ammo. 

Enjoy !
